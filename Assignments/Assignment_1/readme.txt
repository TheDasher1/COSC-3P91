This was coded in VSCode studio (Visual Studio Code).




To run the Assignment_1.jar file from the console, cd to where ever the .jar file has been extracted and run it with "java --enable-preview -jar Assignment_1.jar".

This should run a basic output of an input by the user, since we're not required to have any actual implementation of our code yet but I wanted to have something that proved the project would build without any problems.

I've attached a screenshot of the build running in my powershell (running on cmd might work differently) as a reference.

There is also a pdf of the the UML diagram and the Latex document.
